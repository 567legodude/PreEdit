# PreEdit
Image generator based on predefined templates.  
This project is still WIP, but development has slowed due to other projects.

This is not an image editor in the traditional sense that you make changes to an image.
Instead, the editor is modular and you add modules to the image which affect it in some way.
Going further, effects can be added to modules for further customization.  
The editor also supports loading addons and provides an API that makes it easy to create your own modules, effects, or even custom tabs or buttons on the toolbar.

## Dependencies
