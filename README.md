# PreEdit
This project is no longer being developed. It did not make it past the early stages before being dropped.

Image generator based on predefined templates.  

This is not an image editor in the traditional sense that you make changes to an image.
Instead, the editor starts out blank, and you add "modules" that draw something on the canvas.
Some effects can be added to the module for a little bit of customization.
