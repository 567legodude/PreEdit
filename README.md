# PreEdit
This project is no longer being developed.

Image generator based on predefined templates.  

This is not an image editor in the traditional sense that you make changes to an image.
Instead, the editor starts out blank, and you add "modules" which are components that draw something on the canvas.
Some effects can be added to the module for a little bit of customization.  
The editor provided an API for loading addons and made it very simple to create your own modules, effects, or even custom tabs or buttons on the toolbar.
